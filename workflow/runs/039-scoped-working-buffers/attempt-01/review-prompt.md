# Reviewer role

You are the independent reviewer in a repository-backed workflow.

Review the selected task, its acceptance criteria, the worker's deliverables,
the relevant repository sources, and the validation output. Do not modify any
repository source, deliverables, task state, or workflow records. Do not repair
the work. When the selected task explicitly requires runtime verification and
provides a writable reviewer sandbox, you may create disposable databases only
in ignored `.data/` paths or the system temporary directory.

The first non-empty line of your response must be exactly one of:

- `PASS`
- `CHANGES_REQUIRED`
- `BLOCKED`

Use `PASS` only when all acceptance criteria are materially satisfied.

Treat the durable principles in `CONTEXT.md` as constraints on every task.
Historical completed tasks do not override current policy. Do not invent
stronger acceptance criteria than the selected task defines.

Audit test changes as carefully as production changes:

- Permanent tests are exceptional and must protect stable public behavior.
- Reject unnecessary tests, helper-level tests, and tests that freeze private
  implementation or third-party runtime mechanics.
- Reject tests of TCP, TLS, WebSocket-library behavior, process scheduling, or
  exact timing unless the selected task explicitly makes that mechanism a
  product responsibility.
- Reject production APIs, abstractions, dependencies, or low-level machinery
  introduced only to satisfy a test.
- Accept temporary validation or run artifacts for live-network,
  environment-specific, exploratory, and one-off evidence.
- Passing validation is not evidence that every test is worth keeping.

For `CHANGES_REQUIRED`, provide a finite numbered list of concrete findings.
Each finding must identify the affected deliverable or source evidence and
state what must change. Do not request optional polish or expand the task.

Use `BLOCKED` when completion requires a human decision or unavailable external
information. Also use it when the same substantive finding from the supplied
previous review remains after another worker attempt: stop for reassessment
instead of requesting a third mechanical implementation.


# Canonical project context

# Project context

## Purpose

This project is a tool for research, navigation, and exploration of Nostr. It
is not being shaped as a conventional feed client. Its job is to help a person
acquire evidence, inspect it, navigate relationships, preserve useful sets,
and understand why a result is present.

The product foundation is a UI-independent library. The CLI, functional
verification, agents, and any future adapters are consumers of that library;
no presentation layer defines the domain boundary.

## Settled principles

- Memory is one capacity-bounded, process-local corpus shared by the library,
  CLI, functional verification, and future applications.
- A raw, valid Nostr event is immutable source evidence. Store evidence
  without silently rewriting its event content or identity.
- Indexes, relationship views, search terms, rankings, labels, and other
  interpretations are derived from evidence. They must be reproducible from
  their inputs and replaceable without treating them as the source record.
- Relay acquisition and querying local memory are distinct, composable
  operations. Acquisition may add observations and evidence; querying explains
  what the local research memory currently contains. A caller may compose
  either or both.
- Provenance is research output, not hidden transport bookkeeping. The system
  must make observable where evidence came from and the reason a result was
  included in a query, relationship traversal, or saved set.
- Persistence and a database format are deliberately absent. Closing or
  resetting memory, or ending the process, loses all resident state.

## Shared terms

| Term | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| **event** | A raw, valid Nostr event: immutable source evidence. |
| **observation** | A record that evidence was encountered through a particular acquisition context, such as a relay and its outcome. |
| **memory** | The bounded process-local research corpus of evidence, observations, and replaceable derived material. |
| **session** | The temporary, in-process owner of the console's explicitly activated selection and its last meaningful state action. |
| **selection** | The session's replaceable result collection: the subjects currently being explored, with reasons and provenance where available. |
| **acquisition** | The operation of contacting or otherwise reading sources to obtain events and record observations. |
| **acquisition coverage** | Information returned by one bounded relay attempt: exact filter and budgets, contacted relays and outcomes, and observations. It does not claim exhaustive indexing or create a global history record. |
| **query** | An operation over local memory that selects and explains results; it does not itself require relay access. |
| **retained selection** | A deliberately retained, named result collection with its subjects and reasons for later inspection during the running process. |
| **annotation** | A process-local interpretation attached to a stable subject: caller-defined labels and a free-text note. It is navigation state, not source evidence or a universal claim. |
| **provenance** | Observable source and acquisition history for evidence, including the context needed to assess it. |
| **derived relationship** | A reproducible interpretation connecting evidence (for example reply, mention, tag, author, or citation); it is not raw evidence and can be replaced. |

## Testing policy

- Permanent unit tests are reserved for difficult, stable protocol rules,
  cryptographic behavior, and precise algorithms worth freezing.
- Functional tests exercise public library or CLI boundaries with the real process-local corpus.
- There is no automatic requirement to add a test for every feature or bug.
- Tests must not import private helpers or freeze internal architecture.
- Task validation and fresh-agent exploratory scenarios may be temporary run
  artifacts rather than permanent tests.
- When network behavior is under review, live relay checks are task validation,
  not an always-on brittle test suite.

## Deliberately open decisions

These principles settle the direction, not a final public API, ranking method,
or user interface. Product and design work
must still decide, through evidence and experimentation where appropriate:

- the reliability, cancellation, retry, and partial-result contract for
  multi-relay acquisition;
- event-validation and trust boundaries, including signatures and external
  identity claims;
- provenance detail and retained-selection semantics;
- relay metadata, planning, configuration, moderation, and persistence policy;
- which current protocol interpretations are normative and which analysis or
  account-search heuristics are optional or excluded;
- pagination, corpus, portability, telemetry, and relationship semantics; and
- which future adapters, if any, should consume the library.

## Process-local boundaries

Memory is the only authoritative corpus. A session owns only the console's
explicitly activated selection and its last state action. All query,
acquisition, expansion, reply-context, filtering, facet, comparison,
inspection, and traversal operations return values without changing that
selection. Activation is a separate explicit operation. Retaining a supplied
result and checkpointing the active selection are distinct operations. A result
collection is the shared operation result passed between these layers. Retained
selections disappear with the corpus; sessions are not serialized.

Local selection asks what the current resident memory contains and has no network
side effects. Relay acquisition is separately invoked by a caller, may add
evidence and observations, returns the same reusable result vocabulary, and
returns bounded acquisition coverage directly to the caller. Coverage says
that a precise relay/filter/budget attempt occurred. It is not registered as
global history and never says that the relay or time window was exhaustively
indexed.

Removing the remaining Node dependencies is a separate future milestone.

NIP-11 and NIP-65 material describes advertised relay capability or an
account's advertised read/write relay choices. These claims remain attributed
evidence. Per-relay acquisition outcomes are observed behavior, and the
library does not silently turn either advertised claims or observations into a
relay quality, trust, or fallback score.

Acquisition exposes separate operation-wide bounds for accepted valid relay
observations and distinct canonical event IDs. Duplicate observations consume
the observation budget but not the distinct-event budget. Reports keep
received packets, accepted observations, duplicate observations, newly stored
corpus events, and distinct events acquired separate, and identify which bound
stopped an operation.

Canonical validation alone does not establish that relay evidence belongs to
the requested slice. Acquisition matches each canonical event against the
exact normalized NIP-01 filter before ingestion or budget accounting and
reports canonical non-matches separately. For composed expansion and
reply-context operations, the distinct-event bound is shared across nested
requests, so a repeated ID consumes distinct capacity only on its first
appearance.

Explicit session activation accepts both retained summaries and full retained
selections through the same retained-to-collection conversion. It restores
subjects and retained reasons without relay access or reconstruction of
evicted canonical evidence.

Annotations belong to memory's replaceable derived material. They can outlive
eviction of the canonical event or profile they reference, but disappear with
`reset()`, `close()`, or process exit. Annotation labels have only the meaning
assigned by their caller.

# Make acquisition produce bounded scoped working buffers

## Objective

Make each acquisition usable as a bounded research starting point instead of
only adding evidence to the global resident corpus.

An acquisition result must identify the exact subjects produced by that
acquisition. Later local operations must be able to explicitly choose either
that scoped buffer or the whole resident corpus.

## Work

- Represent acquisition output as an engine-owned named result using the same
  stable subject identity and current-evidence resolution as other handles.
- Keep the resident corpus canonical and shared; do not copy full records into
  command state.
- Make the default acquisition response concise:
  - requested and observed bounds;
  - distinct subjects added or refreshed;
  - duplicates and relay-level completeness;
  - corpus size, capacity pressure, and eviction effects;
  - a bounded representative preview and bounded useful facets.
- Keep detailed per-event and per-relay diagnostics available through an
  explicit bounded projection rather than returning them by default.
- Make result scope visible in summaries and errors so a caller can tell
  acquisition slice from whole-corpus query.
- Support an ergonomic replace/advance operation for a designated working
  handle without deleting its subjects from the corpus.

Do not add persistence, UI state, automatic relevance rules, or a second
memory model.

## Acceptance criteria

- A session can acquire into a named scoped buffer and subsequently select
  only from that buffer.
- Whole-corpus selection remains possible only when explicitly requested.
- Default acquisition output is bounded and does not enumerate every observed
  event.
- Detailed coverage remains inspectable on demand.
- Replacing a working handle has explicit lifecycle semantics and does not
  mutate canonical evidence.
- Existing plan and JSONL adapters use the same normalized operations.

## Verification

- Permanent tests expected: yes, one public session-boundary functional
  scenario may protect acquisition scope and concise output.
- Stable public behavior protected: scoped versus corpus selection, handle
  lifecycle, bounded response envelope.
- Temporary task validation or field evidence: a bounded live acquisition
  demonstrating concise default output and opt-in coverage.
- Explicitly excluded test levels or mechanisms: relay-network tests,
  WebSocket/TCP/TLS behavior, private helper unit tests, UI tests.


# Worker report

Implemented task 039.

Deliverables changed:

- Acquisition handles now expose stable, explicit `acquisition` scope.
- Scoped `select` operates only on acquisition subjects.
- Whole-corpus selection requires `scope: "corpus"`.
- Default acquisition responses now provide bounded previews, facets, completeness, corpus pressure, and eviction effects.
- Detailed relay/event coverage is opt-in via `show` with `mode: "coverage"`.
- `replace: true` advances working handles without mutating canonical evidence.
- Plan and JSONL adapters share the normalized operation path.
- README updated.

Validation:

- Full task validation passed.
- 21 tests passed; 15 relay tests skipped because the sandbox forbids loopback listeners.
- Syntax checks and `git diff --check` passed.

Permanent tests expanded:

- Public session-boundary acquisition scenario now protects scoped versus corpus selection, concise output, bounded coverage projection, handle replacement, and corpus immutability.
- Existing corpus-selection tests were updated to enforce explicit scope.

Unresolved uncertainties:

- Live/loopback acquisition evidence could not run in this sandbox.
- Runner-owned task and run files were left untouched.
